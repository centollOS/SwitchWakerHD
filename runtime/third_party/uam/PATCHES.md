# uam in SwitchWakerHD

uam 1.1.0, https://github.com/devkitPro/uam at `5a5afc2` (LICENSE: zlib for uam's own files, MIT for
mesa-imported/). Built by `CMakeLists.txt` (no meson) as the static library `uamlib`; the renderer uses
it through `uam_api.h` (init / compile, one thread only). `generated/` holds what meson would produce
with bison, flex and mako: rerun `tools/generate.sh` (bison, flex, python3-mako; e.g. the `uam-host`
Docker image) after editing a `.yy`, `.ll`, `.y`, `.l` or `ir_expression_operation.py`.

Every change to upstream files is marked `SwitchWakerHD patch N`.

1. **Real mutexes** (`mesa-imported/c11/threads.h`). Upstream's header is a single-threaded stub; it
   now maps to pthread mutexes. uam is still NOT reentrant (static `gl_context` in
   `source/glsl_frontend.cpp`; three threads crash even with these mutexes): compile on one thread.
2. **DKSH in memory**: `DekoCompiler::WriteDksh(std::vector<uint8_t>&)` next to `OutputDksh`, same
   bytes without a file (`source/compiler_iface.*`).
3. **Log callback** (`source/uam_log.h`, `source/mini-os.c`): the frontend's and the compiler
   interface's `fprintf(stderr)`, Mesa's `_mesa_warning` / out-of-memory messages, `os_log_message`
   and nv50_ir's `ERROR()` (a no-op in release builds before) go to `uam_set_log_callback` (stderr
   when unset). `uam::compile` collects them in `Result::log`.
4. **No exit()/abort() from CompileGlsl**: the `exit(1)` in `st_glsl_to_tgsi.cpp`, the `abort()` in
   `lower_mat_op_to_vec.cpp` and `nv50_ir_from_tgsi.cpp`, nv50_ir's `FATAL()` and flex's
   `YY_FATAL_ERROR` (both lexers) call `uam_fatal()`, which logs and `longjmp`s back to
   `DekoCompiler::CompileGlsl`; the compile returns false and what it had allocated is leaked.
   Mesa's `assert`/`unreachable` stay compiled out (`NDEBUG` is always defined for `uamlib`); the
   `abort()`s in `ir_validate.cpp` exist only in `DEBUG` builds.
5. **Resident frontend** (`DekoCompiler::SetFrontendResident`, `uam::init(true)`): Mesa's built-in
   GLSL function library and type tables are built on the first compile and kept, instead of being
   rebuilt and freed around every `DekoCompiler` as the uam tool does. Same bytes; about 20 % less
   compile time on the host.
6. **Deterministic scheduling data** (`mesa-imported/codegen/nv50_ir.cpp`, `Instruction::init`):
   `sched` starts at 0x7e0. `SchedDataCalculatorGM107::setDelay` reads the wait mask of the next
   block's first instruction before that block is visited, i.e. uninitialised heap memory (valgrind:
   "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)" in `setDelay`). Upstream uam's stall
   counts therefore depend on what the heap held: compiled in one process after other shaders, 89 of
   the prototype's 1561 Cemu shaders came out different from the uam tool's files, and a fresh run of
   the prototype's own uam binary no longer reproduces 5 of the reference files it wrote. 0x7e0 (no
   barrier, nothing to wait on) is what the scheduler gives every instruction before it runs.

Check: `uam_dksh_test` (`-DWWHD_UAM_TEST=ON`) compiles a directory of GLSL files in one process and
compares the DKSH bytes with reference files written by the `uam` tool (target `uam_tool`), one
process per shader.
