// Screenshots for players: the Screenshot binding (F10 by default, rebindable in the Controls tab /
// window like the GamePad inputs, also to a controller input) saves the TV picture as a PNG.
//
// What is saved: the TV picture of the frame shown when the key was pressed, as the game drew it, at
// the internal resolution and aspect ratio (1280x720 at 1x 16:9, 3414x1440 at 2x 21:9, ...), after
// the game's own post-processing and the gameplay mods' HUD, with FXAA when it is on (the window's
// scaling filter is left out: the picture is not resized). Never the settings overlay, the notices or
// the performance overlay. Optionally (setting "Also save the GamePad screen", off by default) the
// GamePad picture as a second file while it is shown (GamePad window or picture-in-picture).
// Where: <user data>/screenshots, next to the states folder: ~/Library/Application Support/wwhd,
// %APPDATA%\WWHD or ~/.config/wwhd for source builds, data/user in a release folder (portable.txt);
// WWHD_SCREENSHOT_DIR overrides. Files: WindWakerHD_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS[_n].png (local time; _2, _3 ...
// when several land in the same second), the GamePad picture as ..._GamePad.png.
//
// Both renderers compose the picture on the GPU into an RGBA8 image (display-encoded sRGB values, as
// the frame dumps, WWHD_DUMP_FRAMES) in the frame's own command buffer, read it back once the GPU is
// done with that frame (Metal: completion handler; Vulkan: the submission's fence, polled at swaps) and
// hand it to a worker thread that encodes and writes the PNG: the frame is never stalled for it.
//
// Test: WWHD_TEST_SCREENSHOT=600,900 takes screenshots at those TV frames (as the key would);
// WWHD_SCREENSHOT_GAMEPAD=0|1 sets the GamePad option for that start (test runs do not read settings).
