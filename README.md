# The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD — native macOS port

A static recompilation of the Wii U version (USA) for Apple Silicon Macs. The game's PowerPC
code is translated to C ahead of time, the Cafe OS libraries the game uses are reimplemented
natively, and GX2 graphics are implemented directly on Metal or Vulkan (no Cemu runtime, no GPU
command emulation).

How it works and how it differs from running the game in Cemu: [docs/how-it-works.md](docs/how-it-works.md).

## What's new in this update

- **Linux and Windows builds** (Vulkan renderer with an SDL3 host), with automatic CI builds for both.
  Fixes from the first Linux reports: game paths are resolved case-insensitively (the game asks for
  `Audiores`, the disc folder is `AudioRes`; this crashed the game right after startup), build fixes
  for newer compilers, `WWHD_NO_GAMEPAD` only hides the GamePad window (`WWHD_NO_CONTROLLERS` turns
  off controllers), and a hint where to type when the game asks for text.
- **Crash logs and Crash Recovery**: every crash writes `captures/crash-<time>.log`. Crash Recovery
  (Save States menu, off by default) keeps automatic save states plus the recorded input, so a crash
  can be reproduced with `WWHD_REPLAY=<n>`.
- **`wudextract.py`**: the disc key file can be 16 raw bytes or 32 hex digits, with clear errors for
  a missing or non-matching key.
- **True 60 (key 7, experimental)**: every 30 Hz step is now exactly the 30 fps game's step (game
  logic, saves and quests stay as in the original); hookshot crash fixed. For smooth 60 fps,
  interpolation (key 6) is the recommended mode.

## Earlier updates

- **Vulkan renderer** (by OpenAI Codex), built into the same app next to Metal. Pick one in
  **Graphics › Renderer**; the choice is saved and used from the next start ("Restart Now"
  relaunches right away). Both share the same windows, menus, display modes, controls and mods.
  If Vulkan can't start (no Vulkan loader or MoltenVK installed), the game falls back to Metal and
  says why. Details: [docs/vulkan.md](docs/vulkan.md).
- **Full screen and GamePad screen modes** (Display menu): full screen for the TV window (⌘F),
  picture scaling (smooth, sharp, integer), and the GamePad screen as its own window, a
  picture-in-picture overlay, an automatic overlay that pops up when the GamePad picture changes,
  or off (⌘G shows/hides it).
- **Aspect ratio** (Graphics › Aspect ratio): 16:9 (original), match the window, 16:10, 21:9 or
  32:9. Wider screens see more to the sides (same vertical view); the HUD stays at the edges and
  menus stay centred.
- **Fixes**: misplaced Yes/No cursor in text boxes at 16:10, quitting with ⌘Q could hang, garbled
  characters in the window title. Community fixes from pull requests #1 and #2 (Miiverse manager
  throttling, shared shader-cache memory) are included.

- **60 fps.** Two modes in the Graphics menu:
  - **60 fps (key 6)**: frame interpolation. The game logic keeps its original 30 steps per second;
    every second frame is drawn halfway between two steps (camera, models, particles, sea, wave
    crests, grass and trees, cloth, weather, lighting). Input, sound and menus behave as at 30 fps.
  - **True 60 (key 7, experimental)**: Link and the follow camera run their logic at 60 steps per
    second (for the actions that have been converted and measured against the original); everything
    else runs at 30 and is interpolated.
- **Higher internal resolution** (1x / 1.5x / 2x / 3x, key R) and **edge smoothing** (FXAA, key 8).
- **Save states**: a Save States menu with 5 slots (Shift+F1–F5 save, F1–F5 load), kept across
  sessions in `~/Library/Application Support/wwhd/states/`.
- **Controls window** (Input › Controls…): a drawing of the Wii U GamePad or Pro Controller; click
  a button to remap it to a key or a controller input, live feedback of pressed buttons and stick
  positions, conflict warnings.
- **Optional gameplay mods** (Gameplay menu, all off by default): climb any wall, direct right-stick
  camera, mouse camera, first person on the mouse wheel, quick doors, fast scene changes.
- **Fixes**: shadow streaks, flicker after loading, doubled wave sounds at 60 fps, camera issues.
- **Tools**: function naming against the GameCube decompilation (`tools/decomp/`), a differential
  harness that verifies hand-written source against the recompiled original (`tools/verify/`), and
  the 60 fps conversion tools (`tools/true60/`). See "Optional: decompilation tools" below.

## Legal notice

This is an unofficial fan project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed or sponsored by Nintendo.
"The Legend of Zelda", "The Wind Waker", "Wii U" and related names are trademarks of their
respective owners and are used here only to describe what this software is compatible with.

This repository contains **no game code, no game assets and no keys**: no executable, no
recompiled or disassembled game code, no textures, models, audio, shaders, screenshots or other
material from the game, and no console encryption keys. It contains only the tools and the
runtime written for this project (plus the third-party code listed under Credits).

To use it you need your own, legally obtained copy of the game, dumped from your own Wii U disc
and console. Everything game-specific (the extracted files, the recompiled code in `build/gen/`,
shader caches) is generated locally on your machine from your dump, and must not be
redistributed. The `.gitignore` keeps all of it out of the repository.

## Requirements

- macOS on Apple Silicon
- Xcode command line tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- CMake 3.20 or newer
- Python 3 with `pycryptodome` (disc extraction): `pip3 install pycryptodome`
- optional: `capstone` (`pip3 install capstone`) for the disassembler helper `tools/ppcdis.py`
- optional, decompilation tools only: `ninja` and the requirements of the zeldaret/tww build
  (see below)

You also need, from your own console and disc:

- a disc image of The Wind Waker HD (USA) in `.wud` or `.wux` format;
- its disc key (16 bytes) in a `.key` file next to the image, with the same base name;
- the Wii U common key, either in a file `common.key` (16 raw bytes or 32 hex digits) next to
  the image or in the current directory, or in the `WIIU_COMMON_KEY` environment variable
  (32 hex digits). As a text file it is one line of 32 hex digits, nothing else; a wrong or
  malformed common key also makes the extraction fail with a decryption error.

None of these are included or will be provided.

## Building

For the Vulkan renderer also: `brew install vulkan-headers vulkan-loader molten-vk glslang` (the
build needs them; the app still runs with Metal on a Mac without them). `-DWWHD_RENDERER=METAL`
builds a Metal-only app without any Vulkan dependency.

```sh
# 1. extract the game into game/ (game.wux with game.key next to it, plus your common key)
python3 tools/wudextract.py game.wux extract game
#    -> game/code/cking.rpx, game/content/..., game/meta/...

# 2. recompile the game code to C (writes build/gen/; stays on your machine)
python3 tools/recomp/recomp.py game/code/cking.rpx build/gen

# 3. build
cmake -S . -B build/cmake && make -C build/cmake -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) wwhd
```

### Linux

The Linux build uses the Vulkan renderer with the SDL3 host (windows, input, audio). On Ubuntu 24.04:

```sh
sudo apt install clang cmake ninja-build zlib1g-dev liblz4-dev libvulkan-dev glslang-dev \
  mesa-vulkan-drivers libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxss-dev \
  libxfixes-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libudev-dev libdbus-1-dev
# SDL3 is not packaged in 24.04: build it from source (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL, release-3.2.x)
cmake -S . -B build/linux -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
cmake --build build/linux
./build/linux/wwhd --renderer-smoke     # checks the Vulkan renderer, no game files needed
```

On Arch-based systems (Arch, CachyOS, Manjaro):

```sh
sudo pacman -S clang cmake ninja sdl3 vulkan-headers vulkan-icd-loader glslang shaderc python-pycryptodome
# plus the Vulkan driver for your GPU, e.g. vulkan-radeon (AMD) or vulkan-intel
```

Wii U volumes are case-insensitive and the game asks for paths in a different case than the
extracted folders (e.g. `Audiores` vs `AudioRes`); the runtime resolves such paths itself on
case-sensitive file systems. When the game asks for text (your name), type it into the game
window: the text appears in the window title, Enter confirms, Escape cancels
(`WWHD_SWKBD_TEXT=<name>` answers automatically).

Settings, controls and save states live under `~/.config/wwhd` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wwhd`).
To check the build without the game, `python3 tools/recomp/stubgen.py build/gen-stub` writes
placeholder guest code and `-DGEN_DIR=$PWD/build/gen-stub` builds against it (the result cannot
run the game).

### Windows

The Windows build uses the same Vulkan renderer and SDL3 host as Linux. Build it with Clang from
[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) in the **CLANG64** shell (MSVC is not supported: the recompiled game
needs Clang):

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{clang,cmake,ninja,python,vulkan-headers,vulkan-loader,glslang,sdl3,lz4,zlib}
cmake -S . -B build/windows -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
cmake --build build/windows
./build/windows/wwhd.exe --renderer-smoke   # checks the Vulkan renderer, no game files needed
```

Run it from the CLANG64 shell, or copy the DLLs it needs (`SDL3.dll`, `libc++.dll`,
`libunwind.dll`, zlib) from `C:\msys64\clang64\bin` next to `wwhd.exe`; `vulkan-1.dll` comes with
your GPU driver. Settings, controls and save states live in `%APPDATA%\WWHD`. Python for the
extraction and recompiler steps can be the MSYS2 one (`pip install pycryptodome`).

The build fails with a clear message if `build/gen` has not been generated. The runtime checks at
startup that `game/code/cking.rpx` matches the recompiled code.

## Playing

```sh
./build/cmake/wwhd                 # options: --game DIR (default game), --save DIR (default save)
```

`--renderer=metal` or `--renderer=vulkan` (or `WWHD_RENDERER_RUNTIME=metal|vulkan`) overrides the
saved renderer choice for one start.

Two windows open: the TV and the GamePad screen (map, items, menus). Click and drag in the
GamePad window to use the touch screen. Saves go to `save/`.

### Controls

Default keyboard layout:

| Keyboard | Wii U GamePad |
|---|---|
| W A S D | left stick (move) |
| arrow keys | right stick (camera) |
| K or Space | A |
| J | B |
| L | X |
| I | Y |
| Q / E | L / R |
| Left Shift | ZL (target) |
| C | ZR |
| Enter / Tab | + / − |
| H | Home |
| 1 2 3 4 | D-pad up / down / left / right |
| X / V | left / right stick click |

**Input › Controls…** remaps everything on a drawing of the controller: click a button, stick
direction or stick click, then press a key or a controller button / stick direction (each input
has a key, an alternate key and a controller binding); Esc cancels, right-click clears. Pressed
buttons light up and the sticks show their deflection, so you can test the mapping; a key bound
twice is marked with a warning. Changes apply immediately, also while playing. A dead zone for
controller sticks and an option to invert the camera's up/down are at the bottom, with **Reset to
Defaults…**. The mapping is saved to `~/Library/Application Support/WWHD/controls.json`
(`WWHD_CONTROLS=<file>` uses another file); deleting it restores the defaults. The app's
single-key shortcuts (R, O, M, N, 6–9, P, F1–F5, F12) and Esc can't be bound.

The **Graphics** menu in the menu bar switches fixes and enhancements while playing (the TV
window title shows what is active and the current frame rate): 60 fps by frame interpolation
(**6**), true 60 fps (**7**, experimental), internal resolution 1x / 1.5x / 2x / 3x (**R**
cycles; the game renders at 1280x720, 2x renders at 2560x1440), edge smoothing (FXAA, **8**),
ambient-occlusion mode (**O** cycles), full-size occlusion depth (**M**), 16x anisotropic
filtering (**N**), the aspect ratio, the renderer (Metal or Vulkan), and a frame capture for debugging (**P** or fn+F12, written to `captures/`;
captures contain game imagery, so keep them to yourself). The Graphics choices are remembered
between launches (macOS preferences; `defaults delete wwhd` resets them).
True 60 (**7**) computes Link and the camera at 60 Hz while the game state after every 30 Hz step
stays bit-identical to the 30 fps game, except the random-number sequence, which drifts because
drawing code draws random numbers too (later drops and ambient behaviour differ like in any other
session; see docs/decomp-notes.md, "True 60 fps").

The **Gameplay** menu has optional changes to how the game plays, all off by default: climb any
wall (with a stamina wheel; B or A lets go), a direct right-stick camera (no easing, adjustable
speed), a mouse camera (click the picture to capture the pointer, Esc releases it), first person
on the mouse wheel, quick doors and fast scene changes.
It also has cheats: all items, the full-power Master Sword and Mirror Shield, 20 hearts / double
magic / 5000 rupees, and infinite health, magic or ammo. Story cheats (all songs, Triforce shards,
dungeon map/compass/boss key, a small key) can change or break story events, so use a spare save
file. Cheats edit the live save data; save in game to keep them.

The **Save States** menu saves the whole running game to one of 5 slots and loads it back
(**Shift+F1–F5** save, **F1–F5** load); each slot shows its time and area. Slots are kept in
`~/Library/Application Support/wwhd/states/` (about 270 MB each) and survive restarts; a slot
made by an incompatible build is refused. Loading works once the game has reached gameplay.

**Crash Recovery** (Save States menu, off by default, or `WWHD_CRASH_RECOVERY=1`): every 2 minutes the
game is saved into one of three automatic states (`states/auto/`, about 260 MB each; the save
freezes the game for about 0.1 s), and the controller input since the latest one is recorded. After a
crash, the crash log names them, and `WWHD_REPLAY=<n> ./build/cmake/wwhd` loads automatic state n and
plays the recorded input back to reproduce the crash. Automatic states can also be loaded from the menu.

Game controllers (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch Pro, MFi) work too; by default buttons map by
position (the bottom face button is the Wii U's B), and they can be remapped in the Controls window.
The **Input** menu switches whether keyboard and controllers act as the Wii U GamePad (default)
or as a Wii U Pro Controller (`WWHD_PRO_CONTROLLER=1` starts in that mode); with the Pro
Controller, the GamePad window keeps its screen and touch input.
When the game asks for text (e.g. your name), a macOS text field opens.

The **Display** menu: full screen for the TV window (**⌘F**, **⌃⌘F** or the green button; the
pointer hides after 2 s without movement), picture scaling (smooth, sharp, or integer scale) and
where the GamePad screen goes: a separate window (which can be put on another display, also in
full screen there), a picture-in-picture overlay in a corner of the TV picture (size, corner and
opacity selectable; click it to touch), an automatic overlay that appears for a few seconds when
the GamePad picture changes a lot (a page or menu switches; **⌘G** keeps it up), or off.
**⌘G** shows/hides the GamePad screen in any mode. Window positions, full screen, these choices
and the renderer are remembered in `~/Library/Application Support/wwhd/display.plist`
(delete it to reset).

## Notes

- Shaders are translated on first use and cached in `~/Library/Caches/wwhd/shaders.bin`; later
  runs replay that cache at startup.
- [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) covers how to profile the port, measured fixes and
  open performance leads.
- Useful environment variables: `WWHD_NO_AUDIO=1`, `WWHD_NO_GAMEPAD=1` (no second window), `WWHD_NO_CONTROLLERS=1` (SDL builds: ignore host game controllers),
  `WWHD_DRC_MODE=window|pip|auto|off`, `WWHD_ASPECT=16:9|window|16:10|21:9|32:9|<w:h>`,
  `WWHD_AUDIO_VOLUME=0..1`, `WWHD_SHADER_CACHE=<file>|0`, `WWHD_AO_MODE=0..2`, `WWHD_AO_HIRES=0|1`, `WWHD_ANISO=0|1`, `WWHD_RES_SCALE=1|1.5|2|3`,
  `WWHD_FXAA=0|1`, `WWHD_INTERP=1`, `WWHD_TRUE60=1` (start values for the Graphics menu; they
  override the remembered choices);
  `WWHD_SHADOW_SCALE=n` gives the shadow maps their own resolution factor; `WWHD_STATE_DIR=<dir>`
  stores save states elsewhere.
- Crashes and game halts write `captures/crash-<time>.log` (crash address, registers, the guest call
  chain, a host backtrace and the last log lines; useful for bug reports, it contains only addresses,
  function names and log text).
- Debugging aids (frame/draw dumps, traces, scheduler statistics) are documented next to their
  code: grep for `WWHD_` in `runtime/src`.

## Optional: shader head start

The first time a shader is needed it is translated and compiled, which can cause short hitches.
A "head start" pre-translates shaders from the game's own shader archives so later sessions
start with them. It is built locally from your files and is never distributed; without it the
game simply translates shaders on first use.

Building it needs a state template (the GPU register states each shader was used with), which
is recorded from your own play: play for a while (the further you get, the more it covers),
then

```sh
python3 tools/shaderprep.py template ~/Library/Caches/wwhd/shaders.bin   # -> game/shadercache/template.bin
python3 tools/shaderprep.py build                                          # -> game/shadercache/headstart.bin
./build/cmake/wwhd --warm-shaders    # optional: compile everything once to fill the macOS shader cache
```

`--merge game/shadercache/template.bin` adds a later session to an existing template. The runtime
picks up `game/shadercache/headstart.bin` automatically (`WWHD_HEADSTART=<file>|0` overrides it).
See the comment at the top of `tools/shaderprep.py` for the file formats.

## Optional: decompilation tools

`tools/decomp/` names WWHD functions by matching them against the
[zeldaret/tww](https://github.com/zeldaret/tww) GameCube decompilation (CC0); the 60 fps features
are built on those names (`tools/recomp/hooks.txt`, `runtime/src/interp*.cpp`, `runtime/src/true60*.cpp`).
Findings are in `docs/decomp-notes.md`.

`tools/verify/` is a differential test harness for a functionally verified decompilation: it runs
hand-written C++ next to the recompiled original on generated and recorded inputs and compares
return values, memory effects and call sequences (see `tools/verify/README.md`). The verified
source itself is derived from the game and is **not** part of this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeldaret/tww tww     # git-ignored reference checkout
python3 tools/decomp/match.py game/code/cking.rpx tww build/names.tsv
```

The assert, string and actor-profile stages only need the decompilation's sources. The
call-graph stage additionally needs the decompilation built (`tww/build/GZLE01`), which in turn
needs `ninja` and your own GameCube disc image of The Wind Waker (USA) as described in the tww
README. `build/names.tsv` is derived from the game and stays on your machine.

## Status

The opening of the game (title, file select, intro, Outset Island) is tested and matches Cemu
side by side, at a steady 30 fps (the console's frame rate) and at 60 fps with interpolation;
true 60 is experimental. Known gaps: geometry shaders and rectangle
primitives are not implemented yet (not encountered so far), shadow edges are harder than on
the console, startup sometimes sits on a black screen for up to a minute before the logo
(a timing-dependent wait during audio initialization, under investigation), and later parts of
the game are untested.
